====
rosc is a dependency-free ROS client implementation in ANSI C which aims to support small embedded systems as well as any operating system. 
Its long-term goal is to become a hardened, efficient and highly portable implementation of the ROS middleware, 
making it a good choice for use in industrial applications or product development.

rosc is not yet available for use, but under heavy development, please be patient for the first release.

<b>Have a look at the branches!</b>
