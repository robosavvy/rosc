====
rosc is a dependency-free ROS client implementation in ANSI C which aims to support small embedded systems as well as any operating system. 
Its long-term goal is to become a hardened, efficient and highly portable implementation of the ROS middleware, 
making it a good choice for use in industrial applications or product development.

rosc currently only supports subscribers and publishers, but there are currently issues with nested messages, maybe also with dynamic arrays.
